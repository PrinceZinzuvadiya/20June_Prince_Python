Que 6 - How will you compare two lists? 

Comparing two lists can be done in a number of ways. One option is to use the set() function. This will convert the lists to sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. Then you can use the == operator to check if the sets are equal.

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [3, 2, 1]

if set(list1) == set(list2):
    print("The lists are equal")
else:
    print("The lists are not equal")

Another option is to use the all() function. This works by looping through each element of the first list and checking if it is in the second list.

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [3, 2, 1]

if all(x in list2 for x in list1):
    print("The lists are equal")
else:
    print("The lists are not equal")
