Que 1 - What is List? How will you reverse a list?
List:-
    A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].

    Python List reverse() is an inbuilt method in the Python programming language that reverses objects of the List in place i.e. it doesnâ€™t use any extra space but it just modifies the original list.

Python program to demonstrate the use of reverse method:-
    # a list of numbers
    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 6]
    list1.reverse()
    print(list1)

    # a list of characters
    list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a', 'a']
    list2.reverse()
    print(list2)
