Que 43 - Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python? 
    The zip() method in Python is used to combine two or more iterables into a single iterable. It creates an iterator that will aggregate elements from each of the iterables. This allows you to quickly and efficiently loop over multiple iterables at the same time.

    For example, you could use zip() to combine two lists of names and ages into a single list of tuples:

    names = ['John', 'Jane', 'Bob']
    ages = [23, 21, 24]
    
    combined_list = list(zip(names, ages))
    
    # Output: [('John', 23), ('Jane', 21), ('Bob', 24)]
