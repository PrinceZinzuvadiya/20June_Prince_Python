Que 4 - Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 
    When using Python lists, the append() and extend() methods are both used to add elements to the list. However, they are slightly different in how they work:

append():-
    adds a single element to the end of the list.
extend():-
    adds all elements of an iterable to the end of the list.
    
    For example:
    my_list = [1,2,3]
    my_list.append(4)
    print(my_list) # [1,2,3,4]

    my_list.extend([5,6,7])
    print(my_list) # [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
