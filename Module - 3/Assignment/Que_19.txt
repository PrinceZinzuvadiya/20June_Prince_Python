What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple. 
Tuple:-
    Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

    Tuples are written with round brackets.
    tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    print(tuple)

 Difference between list and tuple:-
    The main difference between a list and a tuple is that a list is mutable and a tuple is immutable. This means that a list can be modified after it's creation, whereas a tuple cannot.

    Lists are created using square brackets [] and tuples using parentheses ().

Some other differences between lists and tuples include:-

    1. Lists have variable length and can contain elements of different data types, whereas tuples have fixed  length and can contain elements of the same data type.
    2. Tuples are faster than lists.
    3. Lists are more commonly used than tuples.
