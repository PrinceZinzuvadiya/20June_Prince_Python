Que - How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A Python Class.
    A class in Python can be defined using the class keyword. 

    class <ClassName>:
    <statement1>
    <statement2>
    .
    .
    <statementN>

Self:-
    self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.

    The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on.
