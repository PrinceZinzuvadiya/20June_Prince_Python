Handling Exception:-
    If you have some suspicious code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a try: block. After the try: block, include an except: statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.

    Syntax:-
        try:
            You do your operations here;
            ......................

            If there is Exception, then execute this block.
