Que - How Do You Handle Exceptions With Try/Except/Finally In Python? Explain with coding snippets. 

Handling Exceptions with Try/Except/Finally in Python:-
    Python provides a powerful way to handle exceptions with the try/except/finally statement. This statement allows you to define a block of code that will be executed regardless of any exceptions that may occur.

Try:-
    The try statement defines a block of code that will be executed. If an exception occurs, it will be handled by the except statement.

    try:
        # Code that may throw an exception
    except:
        # Code that will be executed if an exception occurs

Except:-
    The except statement defines a block of code that will be executed if an exception occurs in the try
    block. You can also specify the type of exception that will be handled.

    try:
        # Code that may throw an exception
    except ValueError:
        # Code that will be executed if a ValueError occurs

Finally:-
    The finally statement defines a block of code that will be executed regardless of any exceptions that may occur in the try block. This is useful for performing any necessary clean-up operations, such as closing files or releasing resources.

    try:
        # Code that may throw an exception
    finally:
        # Code that will be executed regardless of any exceptions
